### Basic Statistical Features
1. **Mean (`mean`)**: The average value of the similarity scores.
2. **Standard Deviation (`std`)**: Measures the amount of variation or dispersion of the similarity scores.
3. **Minimum (`min`)**: The smallest value in the similarity scores.
4. **Maximum (`max`)**: The largest value in the similarity scores.
5. **Median (`median`)**: The middle value when the similarity scores are sorted.
6. **Skewness (`skew`)**: Measures the asymmetry of the probability distribution of the similarity scores.
7. **Kurtosis (`kurtosis`)**: Measures the "tailedness" of the probability distribution of the similarity scores.

### FFT Features
8. **FFT Mean (`fft_mean`)**: The mean of the absolute values of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) coefficients, which represent the signal in the frequency domain.
9. **FFT Standard Deviation (`fft_std`)**: The standard deviation of the absolute values of the FFT coefficients.

### Autocorrelation Features
10. **Autocorrelation (`autocorr_n`)**: Measures how the similarity scores are correlated with a delayed version of themselves at lag `n`. This helps in understanding the repeating patterns or periodicity in the signal.

### Peaks and Troughs
11. **Number of Peaks (`num_peaks`)**: The number of local maxima in the similarity scores.
12. **Number of Troughs (`num_troughs`)**: The number of local minima in the similarity scores.
13. **Mean Peak Height (`mean_peak_height`)**: The average height of the detected peaks.
14. **Mean Trough Depth (`mean_trough_depth`)**: The average depth of the detected troughs.

### Wavelet Transform Features
15. **Wavelet Mean (`wavelet_mean_n`)**: The mean of the coefficients from the wavelet transform at level `n`. Wavelet transform captures both frequency and temporal information.
16. **Wavelet Standard Deviation (`wavelet_std_n`)**: The standard deviation of the coefficients from the wavelet transform at level `n`.

### Hurst Exponent
17. **Hurst Exponent (`hurst`)**: Measures the long-term memory of the time series. Values closer to 0.5 indicate a random walk, while values closer to 0 or 1 indicate persistent or anti-persistent behavior.

### Entropy
18. **Entropy (`entropy`)**: Quantifies the complexity or regularity of the similarity scores. Higher entropy indicates more complexity or randomness.

### Zero Crossing Rate
19. **Zero Crossing Rate (`zero_crossing_rate`)**: The rate at which the similarity scores change sign. It gives an indication of the frequency content of the signal.

### Energy
20. **Energy (`energy`)**: The sum of the squared similarity scores, reflecting the signal's power.

### Slope Changes
21. **Slope Change Count (`slope_change_count`)**: The number of changes in the slope of the similarity scores, indicating the number of significant changes in direction.

### Additional Features for Window-based Analysis
22. **Window Mean Mean (`window_mean_mean`)**: The mean of the means of similarity scores in sliding windows.
23. **Window Mean Standard Deviation (`window_mean_std`)**: The standard deviation of the means of similarity scores in sliding windows.
24. **Window Standard Deviation Mean (`window_std_mean`)**: The mean of the standard deviations of similarity scores in sliding windows.
25. **Window Standard Deviation Standard Deviation (`window_std_std`)**: The standard deviation of the standard deviations of similarity scores in sliding windows.
